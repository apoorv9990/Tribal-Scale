# Tribal-Scale

<b>General Approach</b> - Created the app using MVP architecture because it makes the model and view independent of each other. The presentation layer is used to fetch data from the API and pass it on to the view.

<b>Features Completed</b> - Used Dagger 2 for dependency injection to inject Retrofit and the presenter. Used Butterknife to reduce boiler plate code. Used RxJava2 to make asynchronous calls.

Given more time I would have liked to spend some more time on writing Unit tests and Instrumentation tests. It would take me another 2 hours.
